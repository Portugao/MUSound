# INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1. Copy MUSoundModule into your `modules` directory. Afterwards you should have a folder named `modules/MU/SoundModule/Resources`.
2. Initialize and activate MUSoundModule in the extensions administration.
3. Move or copy the directory `Resources/userdata/MUSoundModule/` to `/userdata/MUSoundModule/`.
   Note this step is optional as the install process can create these folders, too.
4. Make the directory `/userdata/MUSoundModule/` writable including all sub folders.
